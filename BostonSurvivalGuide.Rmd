>**Overview**

Our team is interested in crimes that were reported in the Boston area (including all 11 districts) from June 2015 to October 2018.    
The main purpose of our project is to analyze patterns of these crimes, underlying incentives, and to see how other factors such as housing prices, income, population correlate with crimes.  
We use four Datasets [Crime Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/boston-crime-data), [Housing Data Source](https://www.zillow.com/boston-ma/home-values/), [Income Data Source](https://statisticalatlas.com/county-subdivision/Massachusetts/Suffolk-County/Boston/Household-Income), [Population](https://statisticalatlas.com/county-subdivision/Massachusetts/Suffolk-County/Boston/Population#figure/county-subdivision-in-boston-area) for our project, and match all three datasets by [Districts](https://bpdnews.com/districts)

**Data Cleaning**  
We removed all missing values from the original dataset and created a new column named "count" to help us count the occurrences of crimes more easily. The initial ymd file was updated to a more workable date frame. We also sorted the data by "DAY_OF_WEEK".   
```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
Population<-read_csv("boston_population.csv")
boston$District <- boston$DISTRICT
boston<- boston %>% mutate(count=1)
boston$date <- as.Date(boston$OCCURRED_ON_DATE)
boston$DAY_OF_WEEK<-factor(boston$DAY_OF_WEEK, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
boston<-boston %>% inner_join(Population, by="District")%>%select(Crime_Type, District, Region_Name, SHOOTING, date, YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, HOUR, STREET, Lat, Long, Housing_Price, Income, Population, count)

We found that there were more crimes reported during the summer (June, July, August, and September); this could be explained by the fact that new students start school during these months.  
  
*Question:* Which day of the week has the highest amount of crimes?
```{r}
boston %>% 
  group_by(DAY_OF_WEEK)%>%
  summarize(crime_count=sum(count))%>%

```
We found there were more crimes reported during afterschool hours which are 4pm, 5pm, and 6pm; this could be explained by the fact that most people finish their work or school during these hours.    
*Question:* Do crimes usually happen during the day or the night?
```{r}
boston %>% 
  transmute(count, day_night = case_when(HOUR %in% c(7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18) ~ "daytime",
                                 HOUR %in% c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,19,20,21,22,23) ~ "night"))%>%
  group_by(day_night)%>%
  summarize(crime_count=sum(count))%>%
  arrange(desc(crime_count))
```
*Answer:* It's more likely for crimes to happen in the daytime. 
```{r}
boston %>% 
  transmute(count, day_night = case_when(HOUR %in% c(7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18) ~ "daytime",
                                 HOUR %in% c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,19,20,21,22,23) ~ "night"))%>%

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("black", "red"))+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="white"))+
  labs(title = "Day VS Night in crime_count",x='',y='')
```

***  

**Regression for time & time_Crime**    
In order to run the regression, we created three dummy variables and assigned a value of 0 or 1 to each of the data entry for every variable. 

* Month Type  
  + "colder" as 1 : from November to April  
  + "warmer" as 0 : from May to October  
* Week Type  
  + weekends as 1  
  + weekdays as 0  
* Hour Type  
  + Daytime as 1: from 7 am to 6 pm  
  + Night as 0: from 7 pm to 6 am  
  
```{r}
time_boston <- boston %>% 
  transmute(count, hour_type = case_when(HOUR %in% c(7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18) ~ 1,
                                 HOUR %in% c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,19,20,21,22,23) ~ 0),
            week_type = case_when(DAY_OF_WEEK %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~1,
            DAY_OF_WEEK %in% c('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday') ~0), 
            month_type=case_when(MONTH %in% c(11,12,1,2,3,4) ~ 1,
                                 MONTH %in% c(5,6,7,8,9,10) ~ 0))

timep <- time_boston %>%
  group_by(month_type, week_type, hour_type) %>%
  summarize(time_count=sum(count))

TIME_CRIME <- lm(time_count ~ month_type+week_type+hour_type, data=timep)

summary(TIME_CRIME)
```

*Answer:*
Regression Function: predicted number of crime = 63666 - 9582 * month_type(dummy) - 32159 * week_type(dummy) + 17244 * hour_type(dummy)  
R-square is 0.7899 which is a reliable regression.  
p-value equals 0.02592 which is smaller than 0.05, so we think the time and crime numbers are significantly correlated.

**Example Washington St.**  
*Question:* What is the most common types of crime on Washington st?
```{r}
boston%>%
  filter(STREET=="WASHINGTON ST")%>%
  group_by(Crime_Type)%>%
  summarize(crime_amount=sum(count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(crime_amount)) %>%
  head(7)
```
*Answer:* Larceny is the most common crime in Washington St. and the second most common type is Drug Violation.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dangerous_street <- subset(boston, STREET=="WASHINGTON ST")
p2 <- ggmap(get_googlemap(c(-71.06,42.33),
                    zoom = 12, scale = 2,
                    maptype ='terrain',
                    color = 'color'))
p2 + geom_point(aes(x = Long, y = Lat), colour = 'red',data = dangerous_street, size = 0.3) + 
  theme(legend.position="")+
  labs(title="Map of Washington St.")
```
By examining **Washington St.** on a map, we found out the potential reasons why the most dangerous street in Boston goes to Washington St.:     
(1). Washington St. is the longest street in Boston    
(2). Boston has more than three streets called "Washington St."    

*Question:* What time in the dat has the highst crime amount?
```{r}
boston %>% 
  filter(STREET == "WASHINGTON ST" & Crime_Type %in% c("Larceny","Drug Violation","Medical Assistance","Investigate Person","Simple Assault","Property Lost")) %>%
  group_by(hour=factor(HOUR))%>%
  summarize(crime_count = sum(count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(crime_count))
```
*Answer:* The highest amount of crime happened at 4pm on Washington Street. In general, it's dangerous from 4pm to 6pm.

**Example Roxbury(B2)**  
*Question:* What is the most common crime type in Roxbury(B2)?
```{r}
boston%>%
  filter(District=="B2")%>%
  group_by(Crime_Type)%>%
  summarize(crime_amount=sum(count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(crime_amount)) %>%
  head(7)
```
*Answer:* Medical Assistance is the most common crime type in Roxbury(B2).
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dangerous_district <- subset(boston, District=="B2")
p2 <- ggmap(get_googlemap(c(-71.06,42.33),
                    zoom = 13, scale = 2,
                    maptype ='terrain',
                    color = 'color'))
p2 + geom_point(aes(x = Long, y = Lat), colour = 'red',data = dangerous_district, size = 0.3) + 
  theme(legend.position="")+
  labs(title="Map of Roxbury.")
```
*Question:* What time during a day has the highest amount of some common crimes in Roxbury(B2)?  
```{r}
boston %>% 
  filter(District == "B2" & Crime_Type %in% c("Medical Assistance", "Verbal Disputes", "Larceny", "Investigate Person", "Simple Assault", "Vandalism")) %>%
  group_by(hour=factor(HOUR))%>%
  summarize(crime_count = sum(count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(crime_count))
```
*Answer:* 4pm has the highest amount of common crimes and it's not so safe until 8pm.  

*Question:* How do common types of crimes vary throughout a day in Roxbury(B2)?  
```{r}
 boston %>% 
  filter(District == "B2" & Crime_Type %in% c("Medical Assistance", "Verbal Disputes", "Larceny", "Investigate Person", "Simple Assault", "Vandalism"))%>% 
  group_by(hour = factor(HOUR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Lat, y = Long), zoom = 18) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Crime_Type, alpha=.005))+
  scale_size(range = c(1,15))+
  transition_states(hour)+
  ggtitle("Roxbury at {closest_state} o'clock")
```
*Answer:* The variation corresponds to our conclusions from the time series analysis.    

*Question:* How many cases were reported for each of the most common crime types in Roxbury(B2) by month?  
```{r}
boston %>% 
  filter(District == "B2" & Crime_Type %in% c("Medical Assistance", "Verbal Disputes", "Larceny", "Investigate Person", "Simple Assault", "Vandalism")) %>%
group_by(month=factor(MONTH), Crime_Type)%>%
  summarize(crime_count = sum(count))%>%
  ggplot(aes(month, crime_count, color = Crime_Type))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~Crime_Type)+
  labs(title="Common Type of Crime at Roxbury (By Month)")
```
*Answer:* There were more crimes during the summer, which matches our previous conclusions.  

**Example Downtown(A1)**  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dangerous_district <- subset(boston, District=="A1")
p2 <- ggmap(get_googlemap(c(-71.06,42.36),
                    zoom = 15, scale = 2,
                    maptype ='terrain',

```
*Question:* How does the total amount of crimes change in a day in Downtown(A1)?  
```{r}
boston %>% 
  filter(District == "A1") %>%
  group_by(HOUR)%>%
  summarize(crime_amount = sum(count))%>%

    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="black"))+
  theme(aspect.ratio = 0.3)
  
```
*Answer:* The crime amount constantly increases from 5 am to 5 pm.       
  
We want to see what is the top crime in Downtown.  
```{r}
boston%>%
  filter(District=="A1")%>%
  group_by(Crime_Type)%>%
  summarize(crime_amount=sum(count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(crime_amount)) %>%

```
*Answer:* The most common type of crime in Downtown is Larceny.

*Question:* How does the most common crime change throughout a day in Downtown(A1)?  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

The distribution of crimes in downtown increases from 5 am to 5 pm.  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 boston %>%

```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 boston %>%

p3 <- ggmap(get_googlemap(c(-71.062,42.353),
                    zoom = 17, scale = 2,
                    maptype ='terrain',
                    color = 'color'))
p3+ 
  geom_point(data=bosdrug,aes(x = Long, y = Lat,color = Crime_Type, alpha=.005))+
  scale_size(range = c(1,15))
```
We think Drug Violation may cause by those bars there.

**Location, Housing Prices and Crimes -- Distribution & Regression**  
We are interested to find a relationship between crimes and housing prices.  
*Question:* Do housing prices have an effect on the number of crimes?  
```{r}
Houseprice_Crimes <- boston %>% 
  select(District, Housing_Price, count)%>%
  group_by(District)%>%
  summarize(housing_price=mean(Housing_Price), crime_count = sum(count)) 
Houseprice_Crimes
```
```{r message=FALSE}
g <- Houseprice_Crimes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=housing_price,y=crime_count,color=District, size=crime_count))+
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Crime VS Housing_price",
       y = "Crime", 
       x = "Housing_price")+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="black"))
ggMarginal(g, type = "histogram", fill="transparent")
```
```{r}
HP_CRIME <- lm(crime_count ~ housing_price, data=Houseprice_Crimes)
summary(HP_CRIME)
```
*Answer:* 
Regression Function: predicted number of crime = 2.041e+04 + 3.884e-03*Housing_Price  
R-square is -0.09435 which is not a reliable regression.  
The p-value equals 0.8248 which is larger than 0.05, so we think the housing prices and crime numbers are not significantly correlated.

***  

**Location, Income and Crimes -- Distribution & Regression**   
We are interested to find a relationship between crimes and incomes.    
*Question:* Do incomes have an effect on the number of crimes?  
```{r}
Income_Crimes <- boston %>% 
  select(District, Income, count)%>%
  group_by(District)%>%
  summarize(income=mean(Income), crime_count = sum(count)) 
Income_Crimes
```
```{r message=FALSE}
g2 <- Income_Crimes %>%

       y = "Crime", 
       x = "Income")+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="black"))
ggMarginal(g2, type = "histogram", fill="transparent")
```
```{r}
IC_CRIME <- lm(crime_count ~ income, data=Income_Crimes)
summary(IC_CRIME)
```
*Answer:* 
Regression Function: predicted number of crime = 46970.0582 - 0.3869*Income    
R-square is 0.3042 which makes it a partially reliable regression.    
The p-value equals 0.03668 which is smaller than 0.05, so we think the income and crime numbers are significantly correlated.  

***

**Location, Population and Crimes -- Distribution & Regression**  
We are interested to find a relationship between crimes and populations.  
*Question:* Do populations have an effect on the number of crimes?
```{r}
Population_Crimes <- boston %>%

       y = "Crime", 
       x = "Population")+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="black"))
ggMarginal(g3, type = "histogram", fill="transparent")
```
```{r}
P_CRIME <- lm(crime_count ~ population, data=Population_Crimes)
summary(P_CRIME)
```
*Answer:* 
Regression Function: predicted number of crime = 1.462e+04 + 2.330e-01*Population  
R-square is -0.00212 which is not a reliable regression.  
The p-value equals 0.3463 which is larger than 0.05, so we think the population and crime numbers are not significantly correlated.

*Question:* What is the most common crime in Boston?
```{r}
boston%>%
  group_by(Crime_Type)%>%

```
*Answer:* Larceny is the most common crime in Boston and the second most common type is Medical Assistance.
```{r}
common_crime <- filter(boston, Crime_Type %in% c("Larceny", "Investigate Person", "Simple Assault", "Vandalism"))
common_crime%>%

```

***  

**Example Larceny**  
Since Larceny is the most common crime in Boston, we want to see where it happens frequently.  
```{r}
boston %>% select(Region_Name, Crime_Type, MONTH) %>% 
  group_by(Crime_Type, Region_Name,month=factor(MONTH)) %>%

  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Region_Name) +
  labs(title="Larceny Monthly Occurrence (By District)")+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="white"))
```
We find downtown and South End have more larceny cases on average.  

***  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```
*Answer:* There were 1005 cases of shooting reported over the four years.  
```{r}

**Multiple Linear Regression**
```{r}

  summarize(income=mean(Income), housing_price=mean(Housing_Price), population=mean(Population), crime_count = sum(count))
multiple
MultiRegression<-lm(data=multiple, crime_count~income+housing_price+population)
summary(MultiRegression)
```
Regression Function: predicted number of crime = 1.037e+04 - (5.014e-1)Income - (4.849e-2)Housing_Price + (4.050e-1)Population  
*R-square* is 0.5805 which is larger than the R-square with -0.09(single housing price) and 0.304(single income) and -0.002(single population), so we think multiple linear regression has a higher accuracy than single linear regression.    
The *p-value* equals 0.01852 which is less than 0.05, so we have 95% of confidence to conclude this multiple linear regression is significant.  

**Correlation Matrix**
```{r}
cor_df <- round(cor(multiple[c("income", "housing_price", "population", "crime_count")]), 2)
ggcorrplot(cor_df, method = "circle", ggtheme=ggplot2::theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="black")))
```
As expected, only income and the number of crimes are partially correlated (negatively). We didn't find statistical evidence for the correlation between the number of crimes and either Housing Prices or Population.   

And we think there are some correlations among Income, Housing Prices, and Population, so we want to consider the multiple linear regression instead of several simple linear regressions.  
```{r}
multi<-multiple%>%gather(key="multi", value="Value", income:population)
multi
ggplot(multi, aes(x=Value, y=crime_count, col=multi))+

> **Summary**  

**Boston is a safe city in general.**   

The most frequent crime is Larceny. Crimes are more likely to happen on Washington St. which has three sections making it the longest street in Boston Area. 

Roxbury has the highest absolute number of crimes, while Downtown has the highest relative number of crimes. Most of them happen between 4 and 6 pm. Housing prices and population don’t have a statistically significant effect on crimes, but income does have a partial significance. 

However, the multiple linear regression including the previous three variables shows significance. More importantly, the area around Boston University is generally safe! 

**We hope our project will help you survive in Boston!!!**
